final azamPayClient = AzamPayClient(
   appName: 'My-App',
   clientId: '4a4c16d1-52cc-48eddf23-bfff',
   clientSecret: 'BR2USg29BIubf...vU5ErDtc=',
   sandbox: true, // set to false for production
);

// create an instance of the Checkout service
final checkoutService = Checkout(azamPayClient);

// Create a MNOCheckoutRequest
final mnoRequest = MnoCheckoutRequest(
   accountNumber: '255764XXXXXX',
   additionalProperties: {}, //optional
   amount: '1000',
   currency: 'TZS',
   externalId: 'external-id',
